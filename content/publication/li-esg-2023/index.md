abstract: The effectiveness of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings
  has been widely discussed in academia and is linked to corporate financial performance.
  However, the underlying mechanism between ESG rating events and firm innovation
  in developing countries has not been effectively explored. Taking Chinese A-share
  non-financial listed companies from 2009 to 2020 as research samples, this paper
  empirically studies the mechanism of ESG rating events affecting corporate innovation
  of listed companies. The findings are as follows :(1) ESG performance and ESG rating
  events with high financial investment behavior can promote corporate innovation;
  (2) The industrial structure, the level of property rights protection and the level
  of regional financial development are the main external environmental factors affecting
  the previous conclusion; (3) Firm scale effect and capital reservoir effect are
  the main internal firm factors affecting the first conclusion.
