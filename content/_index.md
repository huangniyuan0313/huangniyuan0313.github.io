      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
      As a master's student actively preparing for PhD applications, I am currently exploring and refining my academic interests.
      
      During both my undergraduate and graduate studies, I have participated in various research projects under the guidance of professors, exploring topics such as rational inattention, network analysis, ESG, and innovation. These experiences have given me exposure to a broad range of ideas in economics and finance.
      
      I have also pursued small independent projectsâ€”for instance, using XGBoost to fit a multifactor model for performance enhancement, which was the final project in my quantitative investing course.
      
      While I am still in the process of narrowing down my specific research field, I have built a solid foundation in both qualitative and quantitative methods, particularly in economics and finance.
      
      If you're interested in what I do, I would be excited to collaborate! ðŸ˜ƒ
